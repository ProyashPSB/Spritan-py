This is a toy Chatbot written in **Python 3.6** with a MariaDb database backend.  
The logic is very simple - the ChatBot stores bag-of-word associations for responses to a previous sentence and uses this to try to match future responses. 
This is not aimed at any real practical task, it is just a framework for experimenting with and developing further.
